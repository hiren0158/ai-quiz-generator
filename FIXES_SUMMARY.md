# Quiz Generator - Recent Fixes Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Question Repetition Problem**
**Issue:** Same questions appeared when generating multiple quizzes on the same topic.

**Solution:**
- Implemented persistent storage (`quiz_history.json`)
- Added fuzzy matching duplicate detection (80% similarity threshold)
- Enhanced AI prompt with previous questions context
- Questions now tracked per topic and persist across sessions

### 2. **API Quota Exhaustion**
**Issue:** Single API key hit 50 requests/day limit quickly.

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic API key rotation system
- 6 API keys configured in pool
- Total capacity: 300 requests/day (6 × 50)
- System auto-switches when one key hits quota
- Real-time status display: "X/6 keys available"

### 3. **Incorrect Question Count**
**Issue:** Requesting 5 questions would return only 3-4.

**Solution:**
- Request extra questions to account for filtering
- 3 retry attempts with progressive strategies:
  - Attempt 1: Request +5 extra questions
  - Attempt 2: Request double (num_questions × 2)
  - Attempt 3: Use relaxed duplicate threshold (90% instead of 80%)
- Fallback: Pad with available questions if still short
- UI shows warning if exact count not met

### 4. **Submit Button State Issue**
**Issue:** First submit showed only score, second submit showed correct/wrong answers.

**Solution:**
- Added `st.rerun()` after state change on submit
- Forces immediate page refresh to display results
- Now shows score AND answer highlights on first submit
- Improved user experience with instant feedback

### 5. **UI Enhancement - Modern Design**
**Issue:** White boxes and basic design made app look unpolished.

**Solution:**
- Implemented dark theme with navy gradient background
- Added glassmorphism effects (frosted glass look)
- Removed all white boxes with transparent containers
- Modern color palette with purple, pink, and cyan

### 6. **Interactive Features Added**
**New Features:**
- ✨ **Progress Bar**: Animated gradient bar with shimmer effect
- 🎉 **Confetti**: Celebration animation on perfect score
- 📊 **Stats Card**: Detailed breakdown (correct, incorrect, accuracy)
- 🎯 **Difficulty Badges**: Color-coded animated badges
- 📚 **Topic Badge**: Prominent display with glow
- 🔢 **Question Numbers**: Purple gradient badges
- ✓ **Animated Checkmarks**: Pop-in effect on correct answers

### Request Flow
```
User requests 5 questions
    ↓
Request 10 from AI (5 + 5 extra)
    ↓
Filter duplicates & forbidden
    ↓
Got 5+ questions? → Return exact 5 ✅
Got 3-4 questions? → Retry with more
    ↓
Retry: Request 10 more (5 × 2)
    ↓
Still short? → Use relaxed filtering
    ↓
Return best available questions
```

### API Key Rotation Flow
```
Generate Quiz
