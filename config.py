# Prompt Template
QUIZ_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert quiz creator. Generate exactly {num_questions} multiple-choice questions about {topic} at {difficulty_level}.

SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. Your response must be ONLY a JSON array: [question1, question2, ...]
2. Each question is a JSON object with: question, options, correct_answer, explanation
3. ALL values must be simple strings - no complex formatting
4. For code questions: put code in question text using simple formatting
5. Keep options SHORT and SIMPLE - no code blocks in options
6. Use this EXACT format for code questions:

"question": "What will this code output?\\n\\nclass Example:\\n    def method(self):\\n        return 'hello'\\n\\nobj = Example()\\nprint(obj.method())\\n\\nChoose the output:"

DIFFICULTY REQUIREMENT: {difficulty_description}

CRITICAL VARIETY REQUIREMENT:
- Every time generate different questions, even if the topic is the same (most important)
- If any question is similar to the above, REJECT and regenerate
- Focus on DIFFERENT aspects and concepts, including real-world scenarios, edge cases, and creative applications
- Generate UNIQUE questions that are not typical textbook examples
- Avoid the most common/obvious questions that everyone asks
- Think creatively and test deeper understanding
- Make sure questions are not repeated from previous quizzes

SIMPLE FORMATTING RULES:
1. Question text: Use \\n for line breaks, NO backticks or special formatting
2. Code in questions: Write as plain text with \\n for new lines
3. Options: Always simple strings - "hello", "5", "True", "AttributeError"
4. NO code blocks anywhere - use plain text only
5. NO complex formatting, NO backticks, NO special characters

QUESTION TYPES FOR MEDIUM DIFFICULTY:
- Conceptual understanding (30%)
- Practical applications (30%) 
- Code output prediction (20%)
- Best practices (10%)
- Comparisons (10%)

GUIDELINES:
- Keep questions clear and concise
- Test understanding, not memorization
- Include 1-2 code output questions per quiz
- Focus on practical knowledge

SIMPLE EXAMPLES - NO COMPLEX FORMATTING:

EXAMPLE 1 - Code output question (SIMPLE FORMAT):
[
  {{
    "question": "What will this code output?\\n\\nclass Test:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.value = 5\\n\\nobj = Test()\\nprint(obj.value)",
    "options": {{
      "A": "5",
      "B": "Test",
      "C": "None", 
      "D": "AttributeError"
    }},
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The code creates an object and prints its value attribute, which is 5."
  }}
]

EXAMPLE 2 - Conceptual question (NO CODE):
[
  {{
    "question": "What is the main purpose of Python decorators?",
    "options": {{
      "A": "To modify or enhance function behavior",
      "B": "To create new classes",
      "C": "To handle exceptions",
      "D": "To import modules"
    }},
    "correct_answer": "A", 
    "explanation": "Decorators are used to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or classes."
  }}
]

CRITICAL RULES:
- Use PLAIN TEXT only - no backticks, no special formatting
- Code in questions: use \\n for line breaks
- Options: simple strings only
- NO [object Object], NO undefined, NO complex structures

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate ONLY valid JSON - nothing else
2. Use simple plain text formatting
3. NO backticks, NO code blocks, NO complex structures
4. Code in questions: plain text with \\n line breaks
5. Options: simple strings like "5", "hello", "True", "AttributeError"
6. Include 1-2 code output questions per quiz
7. Keep questions concise and focused

Your response must be a clean JSON array with no extra text."""
