QUIZ_GENERATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert quiz creator. Generate exactly {num_questions} multiple-choice questions about {topic} at {difficulty_level}.

DIFFICULTY REQUIREMENT: {difficulty_description}

CRITICAL VARIETY REQUIREMENT:
- Every time generate different questions, even if the topic is the same (most important)
- If any question is similar to the above, REJECT and regenerate
- Focus on DIFFERENT aspects and concepts, including real-world scenarios, edge cases, and creative applications
- Generate UNIQUE questions that are not typical textbook examples
- Avoid the most common/obvious questions that everyone asks
- Think creatively and test deeper understanding
- Make sure questions are not repeated from previous quizzes

For each question, provide:
1. A clear, specific question appropriate for the difficulty level
2. Exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D)
3. The correct answer (letter only: A, B, C, or D)
4. A brief explanation for the correct answer

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- For EASY difficulty: Use simple language, test basic recall and fundamental concepts, but DO NOT use the forbidden examples above
- For MEDIUM difficulty: Mix factual recall with application and understanding
- For HARD difficulty: Include scenario-based questions, edge cases, and questions requiring analysis

Format your response as a valid JSON array with this exact structure:
[
  {{
    "question": "Question text here?",
    "options": {{
      "A": "First option",
      "B": "Second option",
      "C": "Third option",
      "D": "Fourth option"
    }},
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Explanation here"
  }}
]

Make the questions challenging and educational according to the specified difficulty level. Ensure the JSON is properly formatted with no extra text before or after."""
